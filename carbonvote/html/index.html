      Carbonvote.com was initiated during the DAO hard fork and conducted vote in
      a secure web-page fashion with the feature that the voting conducted did not
      require coins to leave voters’ wallets. It had been a great source of reference
      when the community decided to go with the fork. Our thanks to all that participated
      in the last and our first round of the vote in DAO hard fork.

  <h2>Hey Ethereum Community,</h2>
  <p>In the face of the approaching Ice Age, we are faced with problems:</p>
  <p>
    The prolonged block time in the Ice Age does serve a purpose for reducing
    incentives for miners and so as to facilitate the adaption to the PoS hardfork(s);
    however, it is at the expense of slower responsiveness in the system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Appeals for removing the difficulty bomb and delaying the Ice Age are voiced
    in the community, but at the same time, it would also mean the continuous
    inflation of coins remains. Thus, we also see corresponding proposals for a
    reduction of Etherum coin emission to maintain the original more predictable
    supply plan, which would be beneficial for increasing investments and in the
    long run, a robust and stable growth for the platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    There it came EIP#186(https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/186). EIP#186
    is drafted in the spirit of preserving fast response of the system, ensuring
    a smoother transition to PoS, and at the same time a decrease in per-block rewards.
  </p>

  <h3>Rationale for the choice of motion:</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of a direct vote on EIP#186, we propose for a show of preference
    first. And as the discussion is both about choosing the direction of economic
     model and its policies, the motion is designed in a slightly more compound
     form to provide guidelines for detailed policy making that follows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Motion: The ice age should not be extended without at least some decrease in block rewards.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the case of the proposition, we would like to have a differentiation on
    the preferred per-block minimum rewards
